#Homework Assignment
I am updating this form to add to my first homework assignment for class. While I would normally aim to finish this before class, I was defending my comps today. **Happy to say I passed**.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Look at gapminder data
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(gapminder)

##look at Canada data
subset(gapminder, gapminder$country=="Canada")

##subset Canadian life expectancy
gapCanada <- subset(gapminder, gapminder$country=="Canada")

##plot Canadian life expectancy over time
plot(gapCanada$year, gapCanada$lifeExp)
```
