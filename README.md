Stats 545 Assignment 1

##This is the README file for Homework Assignment 1 for Stats 545 (Fall 2017) written by Jennica Nichols
This has been added from RStudio. 

###About Me
I am a Ph.D. student in the Interdisciplinary program (SPPH and Faculty of Education are my two departments). I am starting Year Two this marathon, which (overall) has been an *inspiring* adventure. 

####Before UBC
I spent 6 years in Toronto getting my MPH and then working as an evaluator first as a consultant before moving to work for Diabetes Canada to have better work-life balance. I use to co-own a theatre production company that started as a hobby and, unexpectedly, influenced my research so much so that I am studying research-based theatre. 

####Three Fun Facts
1. I use to live in Kenya (and speak **okay** Swahili).
2. I am a big Washington Capitals fan despite not yet visiting the city
3. I have the same birthday as my mom.

#How I created the hw01_gapminder.Rmd document
In order to add the gapminder work, I had to create a new markdown as I had not saved the one from class. I therefore opened this project, pulled from Rstudio, created a new markdown folder, added text and ran the markdown file (ensuring to save the .md file), and then saved. I then committed the changes and pushed from RStudio.
